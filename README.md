# The literary reception of Sappho in German-speaking countries

This repo provides information about the literary reception of Sappho in German-speaking countries. 

The data produced is part of the dissertation project by Laura Untner ([laura.untner@oeaw.ac.at](mailto:laura.untner@oeaw.ac.at)). For more information about the project see the project description [here](https://sappho-digital.com/about.html).

The [XML/TEI files](https://github.com/laurauntner/sappho-digital/tree/main/data/lists) listing testimonies of the productive literary reception of Sappho are generated locally with Python scripts from an Excel file and are then sorted with xslt/sort.xsl and xslt/n-bibl.xsl.

The [website](https://sappho-digital.com/) is based on the [DSE-Static-Cookiecutter](https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/dse-static-cookiecutter).
